### Enterprise Extensions
```rust
pub struct EnterpriseFeatures {
    multi_region: RegionManager,
    integrations: IntegrationHub,
    compliance: ComplianceEngine,
}
```

## Release Strategy

### MVP (Milestone 1)
- Development Time: 2-3 months
- Focus: Stability and Core Features
- Goal: Production-Ready Foundation

### Subsequent Milestones
- 1-2 months each
- Continuous Integration
- Feature Flags for New Functionality

## Prioritization

1. **Must Have (M1)**
   - Multi-Tenant Support
   - Basic Auth
   - REST API
   - Logging

2. **Should Have (M2)**
   - MFA
   - Audit System
   - SSO

3. **Could Have (M3-M5)**
   - Advanced Analytics
   - Multi-Region
   - Custom Integrations

## Success Criteria

### MVP

- Database Scaling

### Mitigation Strategies
```rust
pub struct RiskMitigation {
    isolation_tests: Vec<SecurityTest>,
    performance_monitoring: MetricsCollection,
    scalability_planning: ScalabilityStrategy,
}
```
